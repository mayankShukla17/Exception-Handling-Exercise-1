#Exception Handling Exercise-1

1. Program1
Create a class with a main( ) that throws an object of class Exception inside a try block.
a. Give the constructor for Exception a String argument.
b. Catch the exception inside a catch clause and print the String argument.
c. Add a finally clause and print a message to prove you were there.

2. Program2
Write a program that will generate exceptions of type NegativeArraySizeException,
IndexOutOfBoundsException, NullPointerException. Record the catching of each
exception by displaying the message stored in the exception object.

3. Program3
Problem Statement: Find character at specified location in a string
**Given a string find the character in particular location in the string**
**This exercise contains a class named CharacterFinder with the following method:**
+characterLocator(String, String) : character
- Should take two String values as input and return a character as result
- Should also handle exception thrown by logic using try and catch

Sample Input:
This is a demo sentence, 8
Expected Output:
a

Sample Input:
This is a demo sentence, xyz
Expected Output:
NumberFormatException

Sample Input:
This is a demo sentence, 40
Expected Output:
StringIndexOutOfBoundsException

4. Program 4
Problem Statement: Find the fraction of two integers
**Given two integers find the fraction and handle runtime exception using try and
catch**
**This exercise contains a class named Fraction with the following method:**
+fractionCalculator(int, int) : String
- Should take two integer values as input and return a string as result
- Should also handle exceptions thrown by logic using try and catch

Example
Sample Input:
120 3
Expected Output:
40

Sample Input:
1200 0
Expected Output:
java.lang.ArithmeticException: / by zero

5. Program 5
Create a class Account. That has following variable and method
   accountBalance : double
Write the Constructor
Write Getter and Setter for the variable accountBalance
Implement the method:
withdraw(double amount) : double
    
This method returns the new balance deducting the withdraw amount from the balance
Throws NegativeIntegerException when amount to withdraw is less than zero
Throws InsufficientFundException when amount to withdraw is greater than the balance
     * @param amount
     * @return
     * @throws InsufficientFundException
     * @throws NegativeIntegerException
Custom exceptions should be used for below scenarios
            
Withdrawing amount from the given bank account less than zero should throw NegativeIntegerException
Withdrawing amount from the given bank account greater than the balance should throw InsufficientFundException
     
6. Program 6
You are required to compute the power of a number by implementing a calculator. Create a class MyCalculator which consists of a single method long power(int, int). This method takes two integers n  and p, as parameters and finds n^p. If either n or p  is negative, then the method must throw an exception which says  " n or p should not be negative".
 Also, if both n and p  are zero, then the method must throw an exception which says  "n and p should not be zero"
For example, -4 and -5 would result in “ java.lang.Exception: n or p should not be negative”
Complete the function power in class MyCalculator and return the appropriate result after the power operation or an appropriate exception as detailed above.

Sample Input 0
3 5
2 4
0 0
-1 -2
-1 3

Sample Output 0
243

java.lang.Exception: n and p should not be zero.
java.lang.Exception: n or p should not be negative.
java.lang.Exception: n or p should not be negative.
